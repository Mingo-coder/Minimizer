# Window Minimizer (Gesture)
Got the code from superuser.com a while ago. 
The link is https://superuser.com/questions/189194/what-is-the-windows-hotkey-to-minimise-a-single-currently-active-window

Minimize windows (as admin) using shortcut key (Win+Alt+m)

Build using AutoHotKey script and can be integrated manually to touchpad gesture.

The another most usefulness of it is that this program can be run as admin so touchpad can finally mininmize elevated (admin) windows.
